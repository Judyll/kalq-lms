KaLQ - A Loan Management System

KaLQ is a Loan Management System that specifically aims to (a) automate cooperative procedures which includes teller and cashier operations, loans processing and accounting functions, (b) generate accurate and detailed financial reports that are based on the generally accepted accounting principles, (c) allow the company to enter comprehensive information on all their clients which includes photos and signature images which can be used for verification and security purposes, and (d) manage cooperative standards which would be very flexible when the need to change arises.
